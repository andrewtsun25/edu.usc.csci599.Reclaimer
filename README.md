Reclaimer is a mobile game developed on Unity in C#, playable on both Android and iOS. This game was built for USC's Mobile Social Games class (CSCI-599). Players start in a jail cell and have to escape the dungeon. Along the way, they can pick up weapons and items in the environment, and fight medieval enemies that stand in the way of their escape.

Players can attack in 4 directions using single-finger swipes. Every so often, an enemy’s attack will be signaled by arrows on screen. Blocking is accomplished by swiping with two fingers in the direction of the arrows. Failure to do so results in getting hit. Players are rewarded to respond quickly; “perfect” blocks on-time result in a powerful counterattack dealt to the enemy.  Players can get coins from the environment, opening chests, and defeating enemies. These coins can be traded for stronger items in the dungeon’s shop.  My role on the team is the data analyst. For every event worth tracking (fighting enemies, combat techniques, item purchases and usage, etc.), I created analytics hooks to funnel Unity Analytics events into a dashboard,. From these events, I delivered weekly reports detailing user activity in-game, providing evidence-based feedback to class professors and the rest of my development team on new features to develop, or existing features to re-adjust.  Media-wise, I also helped develop the video used in the final presentation and composed the music for the soundtrack. I also helped manage app publishing to the Google Play Services.
