# Reclaimer

Reclaimer is a mobile game developed on Unity in C#, playable on both Android and iOS. This game was built for USC's Mobile Social Games class (CSCI-599). Players start in a jail cell and have to escape the dungeon. Along the way, they can pick up weapons and items in the environment, and fight medieval enemies that stand in the way of their escape.

Fighting takes place with Infinity Blade-style combat. Players can attack in 4 directions using single-finger swipes. Every so often, an enemy’s attack will be signaled by arrows on screen. Blocking is accomplished by swiping with two fingers in the direction of the arrows. Failure to do so results in getting hit. Players are rewarded to respond quickly; “perfect” blocks on-time result in a powerful counterattack dealt to the enemy.

Players can get coins from the environment, opening chests, and defeating enemies. These coins can be traded for stronger items in the dungeon’s shop.
